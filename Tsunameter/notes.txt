Log errors:
dont think the cart create has issues, cause i tested it many times. We can just leave the long method for now, who knows they want us to be flexible and have processes which does nothing. 

To replicate log errors:
Nothing special to get the errors, just run any dimensions can get garbage values for non existent coordinates. The log for the garbage value should not exist (e.g. 5 should not have that neighbour anyways, and that log should not exist)


notes for hypo
- run for 3x3 (4), 4x4 (5,6,9,10)
